              <p>"Great" is a decieving term. He's simply intriuging because he touches down on topics that many highschoolers have thoght on, but he backs it up with scientific research and facts. I especially liked when he explained how schools were started as a way of producing factory workers. It was an interesting start to the time line he continues in the video.

              <ul>
                <li>100 years before the videos posting, the government starts schools as a way for children to learn how to work on a factory line, hence why it's graded like product quality and why desks are ussually put in straight lines</li>
                <li>The Great Depression forced many factory lines to shut down, but in order to provide teaching jobs and in hope said factories would restart. Schooling continued</li>
                <li>For whatever reason they continued and quickly became outdated because new jobs and information was created.</li>
              </ul>
